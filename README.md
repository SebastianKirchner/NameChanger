# NameChanger
Small Java Program that allows you to change the names of a large amount of files at once, making them uniform with a counter. Program is now running in a GUI. 

Choose a Path, all Files contained in the directory will be listed in the ListView on the right, you can either:
- rename all files -> Simply write the new name in the Field "Change To"
- rename all files with an identifier -> write the identifier in the field "Identifier" and the new name in the Field "Change To", all files containing the identifier will now be renamed
- delete a part of the filename -> write the part you want to delete in the field "Delete All" which will delete this part of the name out of all filenames (only if contained)

Have fun :)
